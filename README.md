# SST: A Simplified Swin Transformer-based Model for Taxi Destination Prediction based on Existing Trajectory

Notebook file `experiments.ipynb` contains out main pipelines of data pre-processing and model experiments.

Notebook file `hyperparameters_tuning.ipynb` contains the hyperparameters tuning for the baseline MLP, CNN and LSTM models on a smaller sample.

Notebook file `traditional_Swin_experiments.ipynb` contains alternative experiments using traditional Swin Transformer.

Our data is available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pkdd-15-predict-taxi-service-trajectory-i/data?select=train.csv.zip

The code for Swin Transformer is partly from: https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer
